# About This Project

This project aims to design and develop an enhanced LMS that integrates three essential 
features: attendance management, role-based access control, and an AI-powered chatbot. The 
attendance module will ensure accurate, real-time tracking of student participation, reduce 
manual effort, and minimize errors. Role-based access will ensure that each user role has access 
to specific tools and features based on their responsibilities. The AI chatbot will serve as a 
virtual assistant, offering 24/7 academic support and guiding users through the system.
